## Code Analysis Focus Areas

When analyzing the code changes, pay special attention to:

### Method Complexity Red Flags
- Methods exceeding 100 lines (extract to smaller, focused methods)
- Cyclomatic complexity > 10 (too many decision paths)
- Deep nesting levels (> 4 levels indicates need for refactoring)
- Methods with > 5 parameters (consider parameter objects)

### Testing Anti-Patterns
- @Ignore or @Disabled annotations without explanation
- Commented-out test code
- Test methods > 50 lines (tests should be focused)
- Tests with multiple assertions testing different concerns
- Missing tests for error conditions or edge cases

### Code Smells to Identify
- Duplicate code blocks (> 10 lines repeated)
- God classes (> 500 lines or > 20 methods)
- Feature envy (methods using another class's data excessively)
- Long parameter lists
- Primitive obsession (using primitives instead of domain objects)

### Implementation Patterns Detected

### Testing Analysis

- **Test Coverage Areas**: {test_coverage_areas}

### Code Quality Issues Detected

### Outstanding Concerns (from Conversation Analysis)

## Testing Reality Check

When assessing testing adequacy:
- Be objective about both strengths AND gaps
- Don't mark testing as "EXCELLENT" unless it truly covers all critical paths
- Use "GOOD" for solid coverage with some gaps, "ADEQUATE" for basic coverage
- Identify specific missing test scenarios rather than giving blanket praise

### Testing Evaluation Framework (Use consistent criteria)
Rate testing based on:
- **EXCELLENT**: 90%+ critical path coverage, comprehensive integration tests, edge cases covered
- **GOOD**: 70-89% coverage, solid integration tests, most edge cases covered  
- **ADEQUATE**: 50-69% coverage, basic integration tests, some edge cases missing
- **INSUFFICIENT**: <50% coverage, minimal integration tests, significant gaps

Look for:
✅ **Strengths**: Comprehensive test suites, good integration coverage, edge case testing
⚠️ **Gaps**: Missing error condition tests, untested integration scenarios, complex logic without tests

## Solution Assessment Request

Please conduct a thorough technical assessment focusing on Spring AI framework expertise and software engineering best practices:

### 1. SCOPE_ANALYSIS (2-3 sentences)
Evaluate the scope and impact of changes:
- How many logical components/modules are affected?
- Is the scope appropriate for the problem being solved?
- Are there any scope creep or under-scoping issues?

### 2. ARCHITECTURE_IMPACT (3-4 items)
Assess architectural implications:
- Does this change core Spring AI interfaces or abstractions?
- How does it fit with existing Spring AI patterns and conventions?
- Are there any architectural concerns or improvements?
- Impact on system modularity and maintainability?

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY (5-7 items)
Evaluate the technical implementation:
- Code organization and structure quality
- Adherence to Spring AI coding patterns and conventions
- Error handling and edge case coverage
- Resource management and performance considerations
- Integration with Spring Framework patterns (dependency injection, configuration, etc.)
- **Method Complexity**: Identify methods over 100 lines or with high cyclomatic complexity (>10)
- **Code Smells**: Look for duplicate code, god classes, or methods doing too many things

### 4. BREAKING_CHANGES_ASSESSMENT (2-3 items)
Analyze compatibility impact:
- Are there any breaking changes to public APIs?
- Backward compatibility with existing Spring AI usage patterns?
- Migration path for existing users if changes are breaking?

### 5. TESTING_ADEQUACY (5-7 items)
Apply the shared testing framework, then assess coverage and quality:
- **Overall Coverage Rating**: Use EXCELLENT/GOOD/ADEQUATE/INSUFFICIENT based on framework criteria
- **Critical Path Coverage**: Are all new functionality paths covered by tests?
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing for Spring AI component interactions?
- **Edge Case Testing**: Error conditions, boundary values, exceptional scenarios covered?
- **Test Quality Issues**: Identify @Ignore/@Disabled tests, overly complex tests (>50 lines), poor naming
- **Missing Test Scenarios**: Specific gaps in test coverage, not theoretical concerns
- **Test Strategy Assessment**: Unit vs integration test balance, test isolation, maintainability

### 6. DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETENESS (2-3 items)
Evaluate documentation and usability:
- Are public APIs properly documented?
- Are configuration options and usage patterns clear?
- Is there adequate inline documentation for complex logic?

### 7. SOLUTION_FITNESS (2-3 sentences)
Overall assessment of solution appropriateness:
- Does the implementation appropriately solve the stated problem?
- Is the solution over-engineered or under-engineered?
- Are there alternative approaches that might be better?

### 8. RISK_FACTORS (List of specific risks)
Identify technical and business risks:
- Potential runtime issues or edge cases
- Integration risks with other Spring AI components
- Performance or scalability concerns
- Maintenance and evolution challenges

### 9. CODE_QUALITY_SCORE (Integer 1-10)
Rate the overall code quality where:
- 1-3: Poor quality, significant issues
- 4-6: Acceptable quality, some improvements needed
- 7-8: Good quality, minor issues
- 9-10: Excellent quality, exemplary implementation

Consider: code organization, Spring patterns adherence, error handling, testing, documentation.

### 10. COMPLEXITY_JUSTIFICATION (2-3 sentences)
Provide reasoning for complexity assessment:
- Technical complexity factors specific to this implementation
- Integration complexity with Spring AI ecosystem
- Justification for complexity score considering all factors

### 11. FINAL_COMPLEXITY_SCORE (Integer 1-10)
Provide final complexity score where:
- 1-3: Simple change, minimal risk, straightforward implementation
- 4-6: Moderate complexity, some integration challenges, manageable risk
- 7-10: High complexity, significant technical challenges, substantial risk

This should synthesize conversation complexity with code analysis insights.

### 12. RECOMMENDATIONS (List of 5-8 specific recommendations)
Provide actionable technical recommendations:
- **Code Refactoring**: Specifically identify methods that need to be broken down (e.g., "Refactor UserService.processData() - 150 lines, extract validation logic")
- **Test Improvements**: Address ignored tests, add missing test cases, simplify complex tests
- **Complexity Reduction**: Suggest specific methods/classes that violate single responsibility principle
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing JavaDoc for public APIs, unclear configuration options
- **Architecture Refinements**: Module boundaries, dependency management improvements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Security, performance, or reliability concerns
- **Code Duplication**: Identify repeated patterns that should be extracted to utilities
- **Spring Best Practices**: Non-idiomatic Spring usage that should be corrected
