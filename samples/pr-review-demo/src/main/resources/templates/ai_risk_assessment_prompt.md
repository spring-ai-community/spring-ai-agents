## Context Summary

### PR Overview
- **Title**: {pr_title}
- **Author**: {pr_author}
- **Problem Being Solved**: {problem_summary}
- **Files Changed**: {total_files_changed}
- **Lines Added**: {total_lines_added}
- **Lines Removed**: {total_lines_removed}

### File Changes Analysis Instructions

**CRITICAL**: Please read the complete file changes data using: 

```
Please read the file {file_changes_file_path} and analyze ALL files listed in it.
```

This file contains a JSON array with detailed information about all {total_files_changed} files changed in this PR. Each file entry includes:
- filename: Full path of the changed file
- status: "added", "modified", "removed", or "renamed" 
- additions/deletions: Line counts
- patch: Diff content for modified files

**FILE COUNT VALIDATION**: After reading the file, confirm you have analyzed exactly {total_files_changed} files total.

## Analysis Strategy for File Types

### New Files (Status: "added")
- **File information provided**: Use the file paths, sizes, and purpose descriptions for context
- **Java files prioritized**: Focus on .java files first as they have "HIGH" priority
- **Pattern-based analysis**: Analyze using file names, purposes, and Spring AI patterns
- **Work with provided context**: Use the file structure and descriptions rather than reading individual files

### Modified Files (Status: "modified") 
- **Key changes highlighted**: Review the "Key Changes" section for security-relevant modifications
- **Focus on additions**: Pay special attention to new code that could introduce risks
- **Change impact analysis**: Consider how modifications affect existing security posture based on provided summaries

### Java File Priority Analysis
Java source files are marked as "HIGH" priority and should be analyzed first:
1. **Auto-configuration classes**: Check for proper Spring Boot setup and security
2. **Test classes**: Examine for security test patterns and coverage gaps
3. **Configuration properties**: Look for credential handling and validation issues
4. **Controllers/Services/Repositories**: Focus on respective security concerns (input validation, business logic, data access)

### Key Requirements (from Conversation Analysis)

### Outstanding Concerns (from Previous Analysis)
{outstanding_concerns_list}

## Pre-Analysis Context Check

Before identifying risks, first evaluate the overall testing landscape:
- Count the total number of test files and their scope
- Assess if test coverage appears comprehensive or sparse  
- Only flag testing risks if there are genuine gaps relative to the complexity

**Important**: Avoid contradicting positive testing findings. If comprehensive testing exists, focus on specific edge cases or testing methodology concerns rather than general coverage gaps.

### Testing Evaluation Framework (Use consistent criteria)
Rate testing based on:
- **EXCELLENT**: 90%+ critical path coverage, comprehensive integration tests, edge cases covered
- **GOOD**: 70-89% coverage, solid integration tests, most edge cases covered  
- **ADEQUATE**: 50-69% coverage, basic integration tests, some edge cases missing
- **INSUFFICIENT**: <50% coverage, minimal integration tests, significant gaps

Look for:
✅ **Strengths**: Comprehensive test suites, good integration coverage, edge case testing
⚠️ **Gaps**: Missing error condition tests, untested integration scenarios, complex logic without tests

## Risk Assessment Guidelines

Please analyze the code changes with Spring AI framework expertise and identify risks in the following categories:

### 1. SECURITY RISKS
Look for potential security vulnerabilities:
- **Legitimate patterns to IGNORE:**
  - System.getenv() calls in test files (these are for test configuration)
  - @EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable with System.getenv() (conditional test execution)
  - .withPropertyValues() with System.getenv() in test contexts
  - Environment variable access for API keys in integration tests
- **Actual security concerns:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets in source code
  - Unsafe deserialization patterns
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Insecure random number generation
  - Missing input validation
  - Exposure of sensitive data in logs

### 2. INTEGRATION RISKS
Assess risks related to Spring AI framework integration:
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Incompatible dependency versions
- Missing or incorrect Spring configuration
- Thread safety issues in AI model interactions
- Resource management problems (connections, memory)

### 3. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY RISKS
Identify potential performance issues:
- Blocking I/O operations on main threads
- Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Missing caching where appropriate
- Uncontrolled resource consumption

### 4. MAINTAINABILITY RISKS
Assess long-term maintenance challenges:
- Overly complex or tightly coupled code
- Missing error handling or inadequate exception management
- Insufficient logging or monitoring
- Lack of proper documentation
- Anti-patterns that make future changes difficult

### 5. TESTING & QUALITY RISKS
Evaluate testing using the shared framework above, then identify specific risks:
- **Only flag as risk if genuinely inadequate**: Don't create risks for comprehensive testing
- **Specific gap identification**: Point to actual untested scenarios, not theoretical concerns
- **Risk severity**: High for missing critical path tests, Medium for missing edge cases, Low for minor gaps
- **Integration risks**: Untested module interactions, missing configuration testing
- **Test maintenance risks**: Overly complex tests, disabled tests without explanation

## Response Format

## IMPORTANT: Output Format Requirements

You MUST respond with valid JSON in the exact schema below. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

Start your response immediately with this exact JSON structure:

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Always include file paths and line numbers for issues
2. **Prioritize Java files**: Analyze Java files marked as "HIGH" priority first
3. **Status-aware analysis**: Use different approaches for new vs modified files as described above
4. **Distinguish test code**: Do not flag legitimate test patterns as security issues
5. **Focus on actual risks**: Avoid false positives from common Spring patterns
6. **Analyze provided context**: For new files, use the file path, size, and purpose information provided
7. **Provide context**: Explain why something is a risk and what could happen
8. **Give actionable advice**: Include specific recommendations for fixing issues
9. **Consider Spring AI context**: Understand AI model integration patterns are legitimate
10. **Balance thoroughness with practicality**: Focus on issues that matter for production use

Remember: The goal is to identify genuine risks that could impact security, performance, or maintainability - not to flag every pattern that might theoretically be concerning.

**FINAL REMINDER: DO NOT include any text before the JSON. DO NOT include explanations. Start your response immediately with the opening brace and end with the closing brace. Only output the JSON structure above.**
