## PR Overview

**Description:**
When using an MCP sync server, in a servlet environment, use `SyncSpecification#immediateExecution(true)`, introduced in https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk/pull/371 .

This allows to propagate thread-locals to the `@Tool` method; granting access to e.g. Framework's `RequestContextHolder#getRequestAttributes()` or Security's `SecurityContextHolder#getContext()`.

This, in turn, allows users to use Spring Security's method-level security, e.g.:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasScope('widget.read')")
@Tool(description = "...")
public Widget getWidget(...) {
    // ...
}

@PreAuthorize("hasScope('widget.admin')")
@Tool(description = "...")
public Widget addWidget(...) {
    // ...
}
```

The PR addresses a specific technical issue with thread-local propagation in servlet environments, enabling better Spring framework integration for MCP sync servers. The implementation is clean, well-tested, and low-risk, with no apparent reviewer concerns at this time.]

## Risk Assessment

ResultMessage[subtype=success, durationMs=82155, durationApiMs=81130, isError=false, numTurns=29, sessionId=63e59cda-0dee-4c5c-9d32-a2c25e9f55a5, totalCostUsd=0.18623415, usage={server_tool_use={web_search_requests=0}, output_tokens=237, service_tier=standard, cache_creation_input_tokens=308, input_tokens=5, cache_read_input_tokens=24128}, result=I've completed a comprehensive risk assessment of PR #3794. The analysis shows this is a **low-to-medium risk change** that actually improves security capabilities by enabling proper security context propagation in servlet environments.

## Key Findings:

**‚úÖ Low Risk Areas:**
- **Security**: Actually improves security by enabling `@PreAuthorize` and security context access
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public APIs
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Conditional behavior only affects servlet environments

**‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk Area:**
- **Performance**: Changes execution model from async to sync in servlet environments, which could impact throughput

**üìù Recommendations:**
1. Add test for non-servlet environments to ensure complete coverage
2. Consider adding integration tests for actual security context propagation
3. Monitor performance impact in production servlet environments

The change addresses a legitimate need for security context propagation and follows Spring's conditional auto-configuration patterns appropriately. The risk assessment document has been saved to `pr-3794-risk-assessment.md` for reference.]

## Solution Assessment

I've completed a comprehensive technical assessment of PR #3794. The assessment evaluates:

**Key Findings:**
- **Code Quality Score: 8/10** - High-quality implementation with clean code and proper Spring patterns
- **Complexity Score: 3/10** - Simple, low-risk change with minimal complexity
- **Overall Assessment: APPROVED** - Well-implemented solution that directly addresses the thread-local propagation issue

**Strengths:**
- Focused, minimal scope targeting specific integration issue
- Follows established Spring Boot configuration patterns  
- Non-breaking change with full backward compatibility
- Good test coverage using appropriate Spring testing practices
- Clear problem statement and solution in PR description

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Consider adding inline documentation for future maintainers
- Monitor performance implications in production
- Add explicit test for non-servlet environment behavior
- Evaluate making immediate execution configurable

The implementation successfully enables Spring Security method-level annotations to work with MCP `@Tool` methods in servlet environments by conditionally enabling immediate execution, allowing proper thread-local propagation without breaking existing functionality.]
