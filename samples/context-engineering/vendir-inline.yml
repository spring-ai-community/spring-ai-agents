          # Coding Guidelines

          ## Naming Conventions
          - Use meaningful, descriptive variable names
          - Class names should be nouns in PascalCase
          - Method names should be verbs in camelCase

          ## Dependency Injection
          - Prefer constructor injection over field injection
          - Do not use @Autowired on fields
          - Use final fields for required dependencies

          ## Documentation
          - Add JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
          - Include @param and @return tags
          - Document exceptions with @throws

          ## Testing
          - Write unit tests for all public APIs
          - Use meaningful test method names
          - Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

          # Design Patterns

          ## Principles
          - Prefer composition over inheritance
          - Program to interfaces, not implementations
          - Single Responsibility Principle
          - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

          ## Spring Best Practices
          - Use Spring's dependency injection
          - Leverage Spring Boot auto-configuration
          - Follow Spring naming conventions
          - Use Spring's exception hierarchy
