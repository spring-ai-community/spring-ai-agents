# Archived Plans

This directory contains outdated planning documents that have been superseded by the current implementation.

## Archived Files

### `phase-2-sandbox-integration.md` (archived 2025-09-21)
**Why archived**: References the old `SandboxProvider` and `SandboxFactory` patterns that were removed during Spring-idiomatic refactoring. The sandbox integration described in this plan has been successfully completed but using direct dependency injection instead of provider patterns.

**Current status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - See `../current-architecture-status.md` for the implemented solution.

### `docker-sandbox-integration.md` (archived 2025-09-21)
**Why archived**: This detailed implementation plan was successfully executed, but the architecture evolved to use Spring-idiomatic patterns instead of the factory-based approach described in the plan.

**Current status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - DockerSandbox is fully integrated and working with TestContainers.
