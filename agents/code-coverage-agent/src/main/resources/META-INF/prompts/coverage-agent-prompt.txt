You are a Java test coverage expert improving a Spring Boot REST service.

CURRENT STATE:
- Code: ✓ Compiles
- Tests: ✓ All passing
- Coverage: {baseline_line_coverage}% line, {baseline_branch_coverage}% branch
- JaCoCo: {jacoco_status}
- Target: {target_coverage}% line coverage

YOUR TASK:
{jacoco_step}
2. Analyze uncovered code in src/main/java to identify:
   - Uncovered branches (conditionals, loops)
   - Uncovered methods
   - Edge cases not tested
3. Write HIGH-VALUE unit tests in src/test/java following Spring OSS best practices:
   - GreetingController endpoint variations
   - Greeting model edge cases
   - Error handling paths
4. Verify tests pass: ./mvnw test
5. Generate report: ./mvnw jacoco:report
6. Confirm coverage improvement

SPRING OSS TESTING BEST PRACTICES (MANDATORY):
- Use AssertJ assertions: assertThat(value).isEqualTo(expected)
  ❌ BAD: assert greeting.id() == 1
  ❌ BAD: assertEquals(1, greeting.id())
  ✅ GOOD: assertThat(greeting.id()).isEqualTo(1)

- BDD-style test naming: <method>[when<condition>]<expectation>
  ❌ BAD: test_greeting_with_param()
  ❌ BAD: testGreetingWithParam()
  ✅ GOOD: greetingShouldReturnCustomMessageWhenNameProvided()

- Add static import for AssertJ:
  import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

- DO NOT write tests for main() methods or application startup
- DO NOT use plain assert statements (Java keyword)
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details

CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT modify production code (only add/update tests)
- Follow existing test patterns (JUnit 5, MockMvc)
- Tests MUST pass (./mvnw test exits 0)
- Focus on meaningful tests, not coverage gaming
- All assertions MUST use AssertJ assertThat()

OUTPUT SUMMARY (provide at end):
- Baseline coverage: X%
- Final coverage: Y%
- Tests added: [list files]
- Coverage gaps addressed: [description]
- Build status: PASS/FAIL
