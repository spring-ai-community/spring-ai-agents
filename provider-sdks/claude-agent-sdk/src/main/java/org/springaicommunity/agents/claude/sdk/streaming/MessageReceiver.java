/**
 * Receiver for streaming messages from the Claude CLI.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface follows the pattern from Spring's RestClient streaming POC, where
 * {@link #next()} returns null at end-of-stream rather than using a two-phase
 * hasNext()/next() pattern. This design avoids race conditions that can occur when the
 * producer and consumer are on different threads.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (MessageReceiver receiver = session.messageReceiver()) {
 *     ParsedMessage message;
 *     while ((message = receiver.next()) != null) {
 *         handleMessage(message);
 *     }
