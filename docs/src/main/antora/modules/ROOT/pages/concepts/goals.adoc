= Goals: Defining Agent Objectives
:page-title: Goals
:toc: left
:tabsize: 2

Goals are clear, measurable objectives that guide agent execution. A well-defined goal tells the agent **what** to accomplish, not **how** to do it.

== What Makes a Good Goal?

A good goal is:

* **Clear** - Unambiguous about what success looks like
* **Specific** - Provides enough context to guide execution
* **Measurable** - Has clear criteria for completion
* **Achievable** - Within the agent's capabilities

== Examples

=== Good Goals

[source,text]
----
✓ "Increase JaCoCo test coverage to 80% for the Judge API"
✓ "Create a REST API for Product management with CRUD endpoints"
✓ "Fix the failing tests in UserServiceTest"
✓ "Add authentication to the /api/users endpoint using JWT"
----

=== Poor Goals

[source,text]
----
✗ "Make the code better" (too vague)
✗ "Fix everything" (not measurable)
✗ "Update the system" (unclear what to update)
----

== Goal-Driven Execution

In Spring AI Agents, goals are specified using the `AgentClient` API:

[source,java]
----
AgentClientResponse response = agentClient
    .goal("Increase JaCoCo test coverage to 80% for the Judge API")
    .workingDirectory(projectRoot)
    .run();
----

The agent autonomously determines the steps needed to achieve the goal.
