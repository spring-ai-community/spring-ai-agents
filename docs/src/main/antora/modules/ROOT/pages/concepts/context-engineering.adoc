Context engineering is about providing agents with the right information to make effective decisions. In Spring AI Agents, context is provided through the **Advisor pattern**, following the same approach as ChatClient.

== The Challenge

A major challenge with autonomous agents is **context growth**. A typical agent task requires https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus[~50 tool calls] (Manus AI), and as context grows:

* Performance drops (https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot[Chroma research on "context rot"])
* Costs increase (every token in context costs money)
* Latency increases (more tokens to process)
* Quality degrades (LLMs struggle with very long contexts)

== CLI Agents and File System Context

CLI agents solve context management through the file system:

* **Write context to files** - Instead of keeping everything in LLM memory, agents write `todo.md`, research plans, intermediate results to files
* **Read context when needed** - Retrieve specific files only when relevant to the current step
* **Persistent state** - File system provides durable storage across agent iterations

This is https://rlancemartin.github.io/2025/06/23/context_engineering/[context engineering] in practice.

=== Real-World Examples

Examples from production agentic systems:

* **Manus AI**: Writes `todo.md` at task start, rewrites during execution. Recitation of objectives helps maintain focus without bloating context.
* **Anthropic multi-agent researcher**: https://anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system[Writes research plans to files] so they can be retrieved as needed
* **Cursor/Windsurf**: Use sophisticated retrieval to assemble relevant code into prompts without overwhelming context

CLI agents **naturally** do context engineering because they operate through bash and file systems—reading, writing, searching files is their native mode.

== Providing Context with Advisors

In Spring AI Agents, context is provided using **Advisors**:

[source,java]
----
AgentClientResponse response = agentClient
    .goal("Increase JaCoCo test coverage to 80%")
    .workingDirectory(projectRoot)
    .advisors(vendirAdvisor, judgeAdvisor)  // ← Context providers
    .run();
----

=== Example: VendirContextAdvisor

The `VendirContextAdvisor` pulls documentation into the workspace so agents can access it:

[source,java]
----
VendirContextAdvisor vendirAdvisor = VendirContextAdvisor.builder()
    .include("https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco//docs", "jacoco-manual")
    .build();
----

This downloads the JaCoCo manual into the workspace. The agent can then read it to understand coverage metrics and requirements.

See xref:../api/context-engineering.adoc[VendirContextAdvisor documentation] for complete usage details and examples.

== Context Best Practices

* **Provide just enough** - Too little context and the agent guesses; too much and performance degrades
* **Use files for large content** - Write documentation, schemas, examples to files rather than prompt text
* **Scope appropriately** - Only include information relevant to the goal
* **Let agents manage state** - CLI agents naturally write intermediate results to files
