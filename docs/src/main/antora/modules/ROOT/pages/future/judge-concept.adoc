The judge concept represents the next evolution of result validation in Spring AI Agents.

== Overview

Currently, Spring AI Bench uses a simple `SuccessVerifier` that runs shell commands to validate agent execution results. This approach works for basic scenarios but lacks the sophistication needed for complex enterprise development tasks.

The **judge concept** will provide comprehensive result validation capabilities that understand the semantic meaning of agent outputs, not just their surface-level characteristics.

== Vision

=== Current State: Command-Based Verification

Today's verification relies on simple command execution:

[source,yaml]
----
success:
  cmd: mvn test
  expectExitCode: 0
----

This approach can only verify:
* Exit codes
* File existence
* Basic text matching

=== Future State: Semantic Judgment

The judge concept will enable sophisticated validation:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class CodeQualityJudge implements AgentJudge {

    @Override
    public JudgmentResult evaluate(AgentResult result, JudgmentCriteria criteria) {
        return JudgmentResult.builder()
            .functionalCorrectness(assessFunctionality(result))
            .codeQuality(assessQuality(result))
            .testCoverage(assessCoverage(result))
            .securityCompliance(assessSecurity(result))
            .buildHealth(assessBuild(result))
            .build();
    }
}
----

== Key Capabilities

=== Multi-Dimensional Assessment

Judges will evaluate multiple aspects of agent work:

* **Functional Correctness** - Does the code work as intended?
* **Code Quality** - Does it follow best practices and conventions?
* **Test Coverage** - Are appropriate tests included?
* **Security Compliance** - Does it meet security standards?
* **Performance Impact** - Does it introduce performance issues?
* **Documentation Quality** - Is it properly documented?

=== Deterministic vs AI-Powered Judges

The judge concept supports both deterministic and AI-powered validation approaches:

==== Deterministic Judges

For measurable, objective criteria that can be verified programmatically:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class TestCoverageJudge implements AgentJudge {

    @Override
    public JudgmentResult evaluate(AgentResult result, JudgmentCriteria criteria) {
        // Run coverage analysis
        CoverageReport coverage = coverageAnalyzer.analyze(result.getWorkspace());

        // Apply deterministic rules
        boolean meetsThreshold = coverage.getLineCoverage() >= criteria.getMinCoverage();
        boolean hasNewTests = coverage.getNewTests().size() > 0;

        return JudgmentResult.builder()
            .score(meetsThreshold && hasNewTests ? 1.0 : 0.0)
            .evidence(coverage)
            .deterministic(true)
            .build();
    }
}
----

Examples of deterministic validation:
* **Build Success** - `mvn clean compile` exit code
* **Test Execution** - Test suite pass/fail rates
* **Code Coverage** - Line/branch coverage percentages
* **Static Analysis** - Checkstyle, SpotBugs, SonarQube metrics
* **Performance Benchmarks** - Response time, memory usage measurements
* **Security Scans** - Vulnerability detection results

==== AI-Powered Judges

For subjective criteria requiring semantic understanding:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class PRReviewJudge implements AgentJudge {

    @Override
    public JudgmentResult evaluate(AgentResult result, JudgmentCriteria criteria) {
        // Use AI to assess subjective qualities
        String prompt = """
            Review this pull request for:
            - Code readability and maintainability
            - Adherence to project conventions
            - Potential impact on system architecture
            - Overall code quality and best practices

            Changes: %s
            """.formatted(result.getChanges());

        AIResponse assessment = aiClient.call(prompt);

        return JudgmentResult.builder()
            .score(assessment.getQualityScore())
            .feedback(assessment.getFeedback())
            .suggestions(assessment.getSuggestions())
            .deterministic(false)
            .build();
    }
}
----

Examples of AI-powered validation:
* **Code Review Quality** - Assessing readability, maintainability, design patterns
* **API Design** - Evaluating consistency, usability, and conventions
* **Architecture Impact** - Understanding system-wide implications of changes
* **Documentation Quality** - Assessing clarity, completeness, and usefulness
* **Domain Appropriateness** - Ensuring solutions fit business requirements
* **User Experience** - Evaluating interface design and user workflows

=== Context-Aware Validation

Judges will understand the broader context:

* **Project Conventions** - Respect existing code styles and patterns
* **Domain Knowledge** - Apply domain-specific validation rules
* **Historical Context** - Learn from previous validations
* **Integration Impact** - Assess effects on other system components

=== Composable Judgment Pipeline

Combine deterministic and AI-powered judges for comprehensive assessment:

[source,java]
----
JudgmentPipeline pipeline = JudgmentPipeline.builder()
    // Deterministic judges (fast, objective)
    .judge(new TestCoverageJudge())           // Measures coverage %
    .judge(new BuildHealthJudge())            // Checks compilation success
    .judge(new StaticAnalysisJudge())         // Runs checkstyle, spotbugs
    .judge(new SecurityScanJudge())           // Vulnerability detection

    // AI-powered judges (slower, subjective)
    .judge(new CodeReviewJudge())             // Assesses readability, design
    .judge(new ArchitectureImpactJudge())     // Evaluates system implications
    .judge(new DocumentationQualityJudge())   // Reviews documentation clarity

    .aggregationStrategy(WeightedAverageStrategy.builder()
        // Weight deterministic judges for gate-keeping
        .weight(TestCoverageJudge.class, 0.25)
        .weight(BuildHealthJudge.class, 0.25)
        // Weight AI judges for quality insights
        .weight(CodeReviewJudge.class, 0.3)
        .weight(ArchitectureImpactJudge.class, 0.2)
        .build())
    .build();
----

==== Hybrid Judgment Strategy

For complex scenarios like PR review, combine both approaches:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class ComprehensivePRJudge implements AgentJudge {

    @Override
    public JudgmentResult evaluate(AgentResult result, JudgmentCriteria criteria) {
        // 1. Deterministic checks (must pass)
        var deterministicResults = runDeterministicChecks(result);
        if (!deterministicResults.allPassed()) {
            return JudgmentResult.rejected(deterministicResults.getFailures());
        }

        // 2. AI-powered assessment (for quality insights)
        var qualityAssessment = runAIQualityReview(result, criteria);

        // 3. Combine results
        return JudgmentResult.builder()
            .deterministicResults(deterministicResults)
            .qualityAssessment(qualityAssessment)
            .overallScore(calculateOverallScore(deterministicResults, qualityAssessment))
            .build();
    }
}
----

* **Continuous Learning** - Improve judgment accuracy over time

== Integration Points

=== Spring AI Bench Migration

The judge concept will replace Spring AI Bench's `SuccessVerifier`:

[source,java]
----
// Current: Simple command-based verification
SuccessVerifier verifier = new SuccessVerifier();
boolean success = verifier.verify(workspace, successSpec, timeout);

// Future: Comprehensive semantic judgment
AgentJudge judge = new ComprehensiveJudge();
JudgmentResult judgment = judge.evaluate(agentResult, judgmentCriteria);
----

=== AgentClient Integration

Judges will integrate seamlessly with the AgentClient API:

[source,java]
----
AgentResult result = agentClient
    .goal("Fix the authentication bug in UserService")
    .workspace(projectPath)
    .judge(codeQualityJudge)
    .call();

JudgmentResult judgment = result.getJudgment();
if (judgment.isAcceptable()) {
    // Proceed with the changes
} else {
    // Review suggested improvements
    judgment.getSuggestions().forEach(System.out::println);
}
----
